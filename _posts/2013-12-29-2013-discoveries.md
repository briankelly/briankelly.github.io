title:  "2013 Discoveries: My favorite songs from the past year"
---

This was my first full year living in Michigan and raising a baby boy as interested in buttons as myself. Since 2007 I've been creating an annual mix of songs that were in my heavy rotation throughout the year. It started out as a mix CD that I gave to family and friends over the holidays. You know, when we still played CDs in our cars.

Eventually it evolved into thumb drives and dropbox links of MP3s. Even downloading a zip file of music files feels outdated to me at this point. And so I present this year's mix, **2013 Discoveries** in whichever way you prefer to listen.

Hope you enjoy.
